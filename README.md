# Welcome

UI Toolbox is a collection of my explorations of unique UI components. So far there's only one component: a scrubber, but more will be coming soon, along with easier ways to use existing components. Stay tuned!

# Contributing
Any contributions are welcome. Whether they be simple bug fixes, or adding an entirely new component. I don't have many rules for contributing but I do ask that when opening PRs you:
* Be descriptive: Let me know what you changed/added and why. This will make things much easier on everyone.
* Test your code: This will make everyone happier as users will not encounter random bugs and come asking me to fix your code.
* Use proper grammar to the best of your ability: It makes me think you put effort into this.
* Use English: I don't speak anything else, and I don't trust Google Translate.
* Use Unix style line-endings: Just for consistency, plus GitHub freaks out about line-endings.
